Join us this December for our first holiday hackathon! What better way to wrap up the year than get together for some fun and friendly competition?

For those who are new to hackathons – this is a great one for you! Hackathons, especially mini ones, are a great way to dive head first into a project and learn a lot in a short period of time. Hackathons are also great to work collaboratively with other learners to move a project forward and over the finish line – communication is key!
